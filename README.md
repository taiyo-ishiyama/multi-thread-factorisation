Taiyo Ishiyama (s5287456)
This program is written using Mac OS


## Initiate the program
**The users have to set up the server and client using separated executable file.

*eg: ./server.exe  ./client.exe



## The use of the program
Users are allowed to send requests by entering a 32-bit integer at each time. The entered number will generate 32 different numbers by rotating right. Server factorises those 32 numbers and send back each factor to the client. The client prints each received data in the screen.


** *NOTES
** Users can leave the program by entering "q" as the request.
** Users are able to send up to 10 requests being outstanding at any time.
** To implement a test mode, users enter 0 as the request of the number.
